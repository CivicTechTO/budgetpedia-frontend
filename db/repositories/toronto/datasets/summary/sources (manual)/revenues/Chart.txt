Downloaded Derek's 'FINAL' csv's from GDrive from https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B208oCU9D8OuTDNnOUhiWGdWVDQ

Separating code column from amount column for intake process
Code column will form maps_names; amount columns will form precursors

renamed Derek's files form <year>_operating_revenues.csv 
to <year>.revenues.research.csv

make two copies of each of Derek's files
change one to maps_names (embedded in file name)
change the other to precursor (embedded in file name)
retain notes column in precursor

move maps_names files to archive; using expense versions instead - likely more complete

copy precursor files to pending dir for addition of meta headers. remove precursor portion of file name.

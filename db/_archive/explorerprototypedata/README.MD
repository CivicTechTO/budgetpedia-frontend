This folder contains resources used to create a prototype json file for prototyping the budget explorer

The source data file is 2016_Recommend.xlsx (because it includes expenditure data by division)

The source data was progressively put through a number of transformations, combined with category and department taxonomy data and processed by javascript code (preprocess.js) to produce the json file output (budget.json)

This mindset has taken hold among councillors and senior staff to the point where the 2018 budget direction was explicitly set to 'status quo' -- no major changes with no budget growth. We have seen so many red flags regarding the structure of the budget that we are skeptical of this position.

The collective effect of these is to make the budget extremely difficult to understand. This need not be so. At the core of operating budgets is a simple idea: the cost of staff, and the cost of goods and services consumed to provide the services required of the organization. For Toronto this amount is about $8.5B by our estimation (we can't identify a precise figure of course; that's the problem). Isolating other elements, being more precise about the core elements, and applying consistent principles from the highest to the lowest organizational levels would make the entire enterprise much more transparent, and thus more amenable to good management and planning practices. There's nothing special about government operations that we can see, to stand in the way of this approach.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":419,"length":8,"style":"ITALIC"}],"entityRanges":[{"offset":174,"length":18,"key":1}],"data":{}},{"key":"45msg","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"5ufls","text":"Indications of deficient accounting systems","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":43,"style":"BOLD"}],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"akfk5","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"69s7k","text":"We have a number of indications that the City's accounting systems are weak, and data is sometimes inaccurate.","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"89lsh","text":"","type":"unstyled","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"5saeh","text":"Importantly, good bookkeeping is a pre-requisite for good reporting, which in turn is a pre-requisite to good decision-making.
